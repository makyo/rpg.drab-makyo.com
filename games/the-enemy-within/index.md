## Day 3

We had some adventures in Altdorf, shopping for stuff. There were a few folks following us and eventually approached us, but they were shot in front of us. Darkmeadow ran for the hills while we ran for the boat, where we will stay and then travel to the [Schaffenfest](schaffenfest.png).

## Day 2

We fought some corrupted baddies on the road, made it to Altdorf.

## Day 1

We wound up at an inn following a [job posting](job-posting.png), where Bumblebee essentially bribed everyone with liquor. Darkmeadow fought some fancy lady's bodyguard and won a sword, which he ~gave~ sold to Bumblebee, who was in awe of his ruthlessness.
