[Corgi's D&D Campaign](/games/corgi)

We're going to take a long rest in the cave and steal some of the minotaur's stuff. Twenty days of rations, shitty alcohol. The cave wraps around, kind of labyrinthine. There's some doors leading out painted to look like stone, which open into foliage, but we're going to bar the door. We drag all the minotaur bodies into the other room and create the *worst stroganoff*. We camp in the big room for a long rest. Faolan and Eragon want to tame and keep the hydra and keep it??? Snipe and Sarai are pretty nah. The dwarves decide to go with it anyway, while Sarai and Snipe are just kind of exasperated. Snipe turns himself and Sarai invisible so they can sneak past the hydra. The hydra comes out and swipes at the dwarves until they move so that it can snack on minotaurs. Eragon asks Israfil if he can speak with it. "No words. They understand some things, but what I'm not sure." "could we move around it?" "Not sure. Have a strange feeling about this thing. Creatures like aren't normally kept in one place so easily."

Snipe tries to sneak past but gets bit. Faolan makes it though. Sarai tries to blink on Nancy, fails animal handling check. I guess we're just going to fucking fight this thing??? Snipe casts haste on Eragon, calls hound of ill omen, and then blinds the hydra. Faolan shoots a smoking arrow and hits the hydra. The hydra lashes out blindly at hound.

> Strong fl'axe but okay

Eragon lops off two and a half heads. Hound bites hydra. Sarai pats Snipe on the shoulder and says "there, there". Israfil breathes fire on the hydra who starts screaming in pain. Snipe fire-orbs the dragon twice, does a lot of damage. Faolan shoots and misses, but yells out weak points to Eragon. In a flailing rage, the hydra bites its own neck, but is no longer blind. Eragon heroically lops off its final head. The hound, as it disappears, says, "Heh, take that, liberals."

The blood pools out, horrible and black. Faolan steals some of it into one of his vials. We make it across the room, Snipe opens the door. Eragon opens the next door, then kicks open the door after that. There's a minotaur and an elf in there. Eragon: "Who are you?" "Who are *you*?" "We killed your hydra!" "How? I bound it with magicks! Were you not told how to get past it?" "No, we killed it...-yawn-" Haste wears off. Faolan: "Sorry for that one, he's new. Desperate times call for desperate measures, stuff's going sideways in Ard al'Abqar." "You're going to have to explain who you are and what you're doing." "My name is Katish. Things are not exactly going great in Ard al'Abqar." "Such doesn't concern me. I've been given leave to do my research here." "Will you do anything with everyone dead?" "Munjim was supposed to fall, but that was expected. I've been given a write from Rola Tabsh himself." "You could die if you don't get out of here." "How would I die?" "It's chaos out there." Sarai waves letter, "You're Oradras the loremaster, yes? Ira sent us to get you and collapse the tunnel." Fails deception, Oradras grabs letter, corrects sarai that he has leave to do what he wants. "You said Ira sent you?" "The polit sent us." "That bull knows little of the mysitc arts. Would be glad to show you my progress so you can report back, though." "Yes" He's finely dressed, maybe human, maybe elf. He shows figures under bandages with feathers. "You're doing this through potions, grafting, mystic arts?" "Other way around, I'm trying to find out what's happening. They seem to do it quite easily. I tried lightning and it seems to do it when struck just the right way." "Who?" "The crows, of course." "Mind if I take a look?" "These bodies are quite the rare specimen, I wouldn't want to risk them." She's not going to try detect magic. Snipe: "We were sent to check on you, do you mind if we take a look around?" "I'm willing to answer any questions. The rest of the facilities are quite dangerous, I wouldn't go exploring on your own." "Like the hydra?" "Not quite, but we have been keeping...a creature." Sarai, casually: "Back in Ard al'Abqar, folks were all up in a tizzy about dragons." "That would be strange. Why would you want to know?" "Ira Wanted more info." "He wouldn't know. Did you see someone else?" "Saeed I think." "I was told by them that I would be talking with minotaurs only. I have to assume that two dwarves and two kobolds mean that the order is coming from someone else." "We don't know, we just were told by them." "Does the name Israfil mean anything?" "I know of people named that, but no one who would be privy to such info as you have. Come, the desert must have confounded you. Come have some tea." Snipe: "We feel rude, who is your minotaur friend?" "My assistant, don't worry." Snipe will have tea, Sarai says she's sensitive to such. He knocks, calls for tea, and a few minutes later someone comes out with a tray with three cups. "You have to forgive me for being accusatory, it seems you may not be who you say." Sarai: "You must forgive us, the two dwarves in our company come from Munjim." "I'm truly sorry for your loss." "Do you have skills for finding lost items?" "I suppose, yes. I can maybe help fix things, but finding stuff requires research." "Might help with our predicament." "What predicament?" "Monsters come out of the sky, dead rising.." "That's what makes me doubt you. That's part of our plan." "We usually move stuff back and forth in the dark, and are thus kept in the dark. This time we were asked to bring info back." "Strange use of messengers, but I suppose that makes sense." "It's dangerous out there, they're trying to be safe." "In that case, since you don't need to the plan, I have nothing to tell you other than research is going fine." Snipe: "I admit my interest is academic, I'm something of a caster myself. Sorry if I overstepped my bounds." We move to attack, but they see what's happening.

Oradras jumps back and fails at casting something. Eragon jumps in and kills the servant in one fell swoop. Faolan's dagger hits, poisons, then Faolan arrows him. Snipe accidentally ray-of-frosts Eragon. Minotaur fails a spell and moves. Sarai arrows him twice, once with hail of thorns, and Israfil flies in to make chompy noises at him. Oradras tries to cast a spell, fails. Eragon fl'axes a question to the minotaur. Faolan runs around to pick up the dagger, sneak-attacks guy in the foot with an arrow for a lot of damage, completely incapacitates him. Snipe firebolts minotaur. Mage yells that he can't get captured, so the minotaur runs over to attack him with an ethereal blade, slashes but doesn't quite kill him. Sarai runs over and shoots him twice, Israfil lights him on fire, and Eragon kills him.

Sarai stabilizes Oradras with a healing pack, says, "Welcome to Goodberry, home of the Goodberry" and feeds him one. Snipe investigates the bedroom. Faolan and Eragon start interrogation. O: "Why have you done this?" Eragon: "Why did you blow up munjim?" O: "It's where the spheres touched, closest point to do the ritual. It's all part of the plan." E: "GONNA CUT YOU" O: "You can't frighten me, dwarf." "If you can't be intimidated by harm to yourself. -froth-" O: "Dwarves amirite." F: "You did something irreversible. Fine. I don't care. What the fuck did you do?" O: "You do seem more reasonable. What do you know about magic? Some of it is caused by imagination, of course, but some is caused by real things." F: "The world is inhabited by such. Cool. Why?" O: "Not this world, our world. They drift together. We don't know why. They exist as spheres, but occasionally their boundaries overlap." F: "What have you been doing?" O: "I've been trying to figure out the workings of those who would wish to stop this. Have you never heard the stories of the ancient elven empires? In days long gone, the elves made great use of magic. They stopped, but not by choice. They were cut off." F: "So by opening up this tear, you're enabling powerful magic?" O: "Originally the two worlds were one and were torn apart by jealous gods." F: "What would happen if our worlds would fully merge once more?" O: "The mystical would be mundane once more." Eragon and Faolan argue about what's powerful - magic or fl'eghks. Sarai: "What do the kobolds have to do with this? Dreams etc." O: "That's unfortunate." Israfil: "The angry dwarf has a point. The power he speaks of was locked away for good reason." E and S start arguing about whether or no. "This sorcerer speaks of magic and power, but now the demons are pouring forth?" O: "I know many things about the kobolds, but the specific mechanisms I cannot describe." Sn: "Are these things on the tables things that came through from the other plane?" O: "No, unfortunately. They are driven to prevent these spheres from touching. They are elves, dwarves, humans, somehow driven to stop this. They are changed and united to keep the two worlds separate. I'm working on this plan, though without me, it will continue on at a slower rate." F: "We were able to overtake you, do you think these others would be more successful?" O: "Before you judge, seek an audience with Rola Tabsh." F: "What would be required to join your organization?" O: "Your dragon would be of the utmost importance." Grump faces all around. Israfil looks sheepish. Sn: "If the goal is to bring this about, would you know anything about the spellcasting prisoners being held in al'abqar?" O: "All of these creatures have innate magical powers. The new ones are test subjects to see if we can reverse the changes these have gone through. Most rituals have failed, they die." Sn: "Are there any here held alive?" O: "No" Sn: "More details?" O: "There was supposed to be one showing up today. Don't suppose you know about that? An elf?" Sn: "We seem to have really fucked up your day." O: "What did you dooooo?" Sarai: "We gave him an elf." O: "Oh for fuck's sake." Sn: "What's behind the door?" O: "Key's in my pocket, see for yourself, get killed for all I care." E: "Has a minotaur that could not shut up about mahogany been through here? He had a false horn." O: "Generally equipment is taken off prisoners, but no, I don't know anyone by that description." F: "Anyone else? Should we put him out of our misery?" Sn: "We could see what's behind the doors using him as bait?" Sarai looks through his pockets, finds two pp, the key to the other room, quite nice quarter staff (nice, ornate, but not super practical), a golden pendant with a circular motif with a pitch black shard embedded in the gold. Sn: "What's this?" O: "I won't be needing that if I'm dead." S: "Your death could be quick or..." O: "someone ought to know. That's the Other Trickster Shard (they're both called the Other)." Faolan asks about the pendant, he doesn't know. O: "I sense your intentions." E: "At the end of the day, I'm still alive" Cleaves in half.

(Maybe next weekend, the 12th, the 2nd.)
