[Corgi's D&D Campaign](/games/corgi)

Erogan has feelings, apparently??? We decide to go to the coffeeshop, poison the assassins, and break out the dwarf there. Gets some of the assassins out of the way. We make it in. Erogan has Snipe cause sound of a bunch of boxes falling in an alleyway.

> Make a stealth check.

> I don't want to do a stealth check, I want to make an athletics check.

Erogan poisons 8 minotaurs, starts attacking one of the minotaurs loudly so the rest of us hear. The battle starts, we all rush in. Erogan straight up murders a bitch. Twice. Snipe hastifies Erogan. Faolan tries to run in to make a horrible pun, but only manages to yell it in the window. Israfil sets some folks on fire while Sarai heals up Erogan.

> Poison saves lives.

Erogan hastily murders more folks.

> That's a latte damage

Snipe accidentally firebolts Erogan for 19??Â¿? Then basically everyone hits him again. Down to 1 health. Sarai heals him. Erogan kills a bunch more dudes. Snipe kills a dude too. Snipe nearly dies, so Sarai moves healing spirit on him and arrows the guy attacking him twice. Erogan kills him. Faolan does **one whole damage**. Sarai, taking a cue from Faolan, nearly crit fails her own attack, then extra-attacks for at least a bit of damage. Erogan just cuts the guy in half

Israfil asks, "Is it tradition to light the dwarves on fire?" Sarai: "It is impolite to set them on fire, but may be tradition" Israfil toasts Erogan a bit.

Minotaur barkeep doesn't know much. Sarai asks, "Big minotaur lady. Spear. Tihan?" Barkeep: "Kill me now!" Faolan cuts off his finger. Barkeep: "I know as much as most people, and that's not much. If I tell you more, she will be here." Faolan slits his throat. We get one of the 4 locks open, then pry the rest of the locks open. There are four minotaurs inside. We try to intimidate, but crit fail, so they get rushed. Going to cast darkness and folks are going to run into the room. It's kinda awful at first, but then they start attacking blindly and hurt each other. Sarai blinks with Nancy toward the door and lets a *very angry dwarf* out. Erogan slices up some cow. Snipe casts a voice yelling "death to communism" in the middle of the darkness. Dwarven hammer dude attacks in the darkness, hammer leaves a trail of fire. Israfil and Snipe barbecue some minotaurs.

Israfil tries to breathe in fire instead of breathing it out, and starts coughing.

"Erogan? Took you fucking long enough to fucking rescue me!" Blacksmith (Tov Bejan) yells and hollers. We get him his stuff back. We loot.

When we get back out, we see a member of the polit Rosea who recognizes them. She seems concerned and surprised rather than angry, hearing about the capturing of refugees. Her guards are less than thrilled, but decide to go along with us.
