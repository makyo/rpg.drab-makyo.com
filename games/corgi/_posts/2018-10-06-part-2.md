[Corgi's D&D Campaign](/games/corgi)

Doors are barred, king's all fucked up.

Run outside near the customs area, but behind us the whole mountain is gently shaking. There's rubble falling down the mountain, as faolan sees. There's a horrible scream from the mountain and there's a huge red light, then all the finery and everything kind of explodes.

The world seems incredibly wrong. The sky is black, the moon is red (even bleeding), and the sand is glowing white. Doxi's rather focused on the power vacuum. Everything feels light and strange, and none of us feel well.

Given the current fucked up situation, we consider running to Fustat after looking for food in the customs area buildings. Everyone but Sarai goes in to check out the building, since she's too shook from getting beaned by a rock. The other three go looking into the house (Faolan is confused as to what a house is, runs into a wall, and jumps out of the way before he gets rocked). Find: gold bar, herbs, 5 days rations for one person.
