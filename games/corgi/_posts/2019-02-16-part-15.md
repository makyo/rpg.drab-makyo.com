[Corgi's D&D Campaign](/games/corgi)

We decide to let the two minotaurs go, but shoot them in the back. Do so handily.

Find 2cp 3sp 8gp 6pp (we get 1pp each except doxy), controversial druid writings about how the main religion is bad, book on basic poisons (snipe), book on math, book The Virtue of Salt, 3 books written in minotaur, 20 arrows (sarai), fine quiver (sarai), disguise kit (snipe), 2 rolls fine silk, 3 pounds of hematite, onyx ring, potion filled with red liquid that glimmers (eragon drinks), bronze ring with coffee bean (snipe, vaguely magical), finely crafted flute, 3 medical kits, 1gp each, 3 shortswords, 4 light crossbows, scimitar, 20 crossbow bolts, 5 darts, oddly shaped dagger that excretes green liquid from tip (poison), small sack of bearings, dueler's fest, poisoner's kit, roll of parchment, crowbar, vial of poison, box of red chalk in a fine wooden box, ~~common clothes~~

There's a trapdoor. Corridor. Strange arcane voices "You killed th emaster, now make a deal". There's a lizardy guy and lots of blood. Sarai stays upstairs. Is demon. They free it. They find Said chained to a post in the basement. He's been down there for months, maybe replaced with body double. Was planning to meet with guy who bought faolan's ring, elves and assassins jumped out and covered his vision and took him away.

Other room. Faint warmth coming from egg on pedestal. Keep it.

Said upstairs, "Hang on, this arhan's house, head of assassins" We short-rest and tell him about witch trial, exonerate one of our friends, track them down after weird stuff in polit, about how there's a version of him up there. We level up. Head back to the sewer to head to Sliscus. Said hates the market because of course.

Sliscus wants Said dead. Sliscus hears about arhan's house, gives sliscus 5pp. We kinda shrug after some debate, give him over. Sliscus mentions to Sarai and Snipe that this was maybe a bad idea as the assassins are likely to go to to the prison to regroup. Sarai 

Sarai pulls Snipe aside, they split the platinum between the two of them without telling the other.

Melo and Tid, two kobolds from Sarai's guild, run up and pour wine over her, customary greeting after seeing a long time, dark-scaled twins from her guild. She mentions munjim, they know what happened. They say "black kobold buying up all the emeralds everywhere we go". Black is unnatural, Faolan has heard that there's a black kobold all in black going around doing what he wants, killing people in his way, those who die seem to die of drowning.

> Swamp, cold, soup, and hot: the four elements.

Melo and Tid complete each others sentences, say there's a guild hall for her guild down the hall. See egg, jump all over Faolan, laugh about "bet it has three kobolds, no four in it". They run off telling Sarai to look them up later.

Go to esoteric quarter, elf covered in iconography, says he's only heard about it in legends. Perhaps its a sign from the lord himself! Are you familiar with the myth of dragons, and them in scripture? Great force for good or evil. He places it over the stove, it starts to crack open with claws appearing, he grabs a pillow to put the egg on it. Claws and hand appears, color of brass. Bronze, scaly arm and head appear. Dragon curls up in pillows, size of small corgi. Takes to Sarai immediately, "My name is Israfil, what is yours?" "Mine is Sarai, little one, it's nice to meet you" "will you protect me?" "I will!"
