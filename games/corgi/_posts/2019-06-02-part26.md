[Corgi's D&D Campaign](/games/corgi)

Snipe tries to take the usual path back to the market, but the path is clogged up with rubble and stuff. We're going to try and look for another way back into the main sewer from this outlet. Snipe rambles on about the sewer system and how it ramifies through the city. Faolan is actually pretty good at this, weirdly??? Faolan hears some voices up ahead. He and Snipe try and sneak up ahead to hear the voice, but Sn splashes about a bit, and the voices get startled and they hear movement. He's gonna just try and approach and see what happens while Faolan hides in the darkness. A minotaur looks right at Snipe, who says "Oh, hey, 'sup" Min: "who the hell are you?" He yells off to the side, says, "Surrender your weapons and I'll take you in alive." Sn throws down his staff, minotaur tries to put stocks on sn, who subtly casts firebolt, while Faolan saber-of-truths minotaur w/ sneak attack. They kill him, grab the others, Sarai grabs two silver off of him. E peeks into the room and sees a makeshift hospital with a bunch of wounded minotaurs. E tries to imitate the one healthy guy with 3.6 roentgen, min doesn't seem very intimidating, but guy's taken aback. F sneaks in and talks about roast beef, guy runs away

E says "WHAT'S THIS WAY GUYS" and stomps down the hall, sn runs after. Meanwhile, F poisons one of the minotaurs??? "Personal vendetta."

> The guy's got a crossbow bolt in the side of his.. his what do you call it... oh yeah, shoulder.

Eragon finds a barricade and a bunch of dead minotaurs. E looks at the barricade, sees that it is, indeed, a barricade. sn sees minotaurs died from crossbow bolts. S calls out "two dwarves, two kobolds", hears minotaurs saying "shit, they brought up some from behind." E continues to stomp on down the hall while we run to catch up. F sees a room that he recognizes as the tavern the dwarves were staying in. In it is a minotaur in a black robe with a staff and two lizards skulking about

> I call out to my lizard bretheren!

E peeks through the keyhole in the door into the tavern, sees some dead kobolds and a minotaurs, a kobold tied to the chair. Sn casts haste on eragon who kicks down the door and races into the room. S hears a noise behind them, turns to face that. E runs in and fl'aghks the minotaur once, but on the second the ax flies off and hits the kobold. He draws his fl'eghks and hits him with that for the next attack. Faolan runs in to saber, but misses. Sarai and snipe ready attacks. Israfil flies down to the entrance to look for th esound but doesn't hear it. Eragon and faolan run kill one minotaur and run into attack the next. Sn firebolts the mage right in the face. Assassin comes out and hits israfil for a lot of points. Mage runs up to try and cast something on sn but fails. Other minotaur casts something on himself and has a blue glow surround himself. Other other minotaur swings and misses at E. S fucking murders the mage with two crit successes legolas style. Israfil gently lights assassin on fire, flies back (AoO fails). E murders one minotaur, hits the other. Final minotaur in the tavern holds kobold hostage "drop weapons". Sn firebolts assassin, who runs away and vanishes. Lizard, no longer under control, bites and lashes at sarai, hurting her pretty bad. min who cast spell tries one on e, fails. S and I attack lizard for 19, but still looks healthy. S blinks away with nancy and redraws bow. E javalins the hostage-taker and knocks him off balance, dashing (AoO fails) toward him with fl'eghks sword flailing wildly, proceding to accidentally behead kobold and murdering the minotaur. E and F hastily agree to tell S and Sn that th eminotaurs did the beheading and that F actually landed some attacks in exchange for th eloot on the corpses. Sn hits the remaining lizard, who then crit succeeds on his attack, and lashes at Israfil. F jumps up on a table after missing another attack. Remaining minotaur shoots at E and misses. S hits liz twice, I misses. E runs after guy, misses attacks, but F brainbusters him. Sn crit fails firebolt, his israfil, who takes it as a compliment. S murders lizard, heals Sn and I. S and Sn hear a noise down the bridge, E and F hear shouting and a crossbow bolt hitting the wall. We hide for a bit, S readying attack against entryway while Sn heals to full, E fatigued.

S and Sn make it back into the room. S notices beheaded kobold and no minotaurs with swords.

> You hear minotaurs
>
> What do they say?
>
> Roll Perception
>
> That's a weird thing to say.

Faolan stealthily opens to door to peek around into the hallway, see loads of dead kobolds and a bunch of minotaurs grouping around a door where crossbow bolts are coming from. Faolan sneakily shortbows one of the minotaurs. They all start screaming, and there's yelling from the other room as more crossbow bolts come through the door. Eragon rushes in to fl'axe the guy. other min, in his confusion, kills that guy. Sn chromatic orbs guy twice. Min hits E for a bit of damage. F kills him and hides. S snipes one of the minotaurs and I tries to put them to sleep, fails. Human runs out and yells "HERE WE FUCKIN GO" E runs in to fl'axe one of the minotaurs. H fails to spear a minotaur. Min pushes E into the sewer water. Sn firebolts pushy min, kills him. Other min surrenders to human. F runs out behind the surrendered min and yells at the assassin to surrender "or you'll die the most painful death, and trust me, I can think of plenty of ways," min freaks out and looks ready to fight or die. E gets out of the water. H goes to attack min, fails. F runs up to look up in the other room, sees two kobbles and a elf, all train weapons on him. F "we're the ones killing minotaurs" K: "are you the one with the loud friend?" elf drops bow. S snipes min twice, I bites. Min attacks human, hits. E runs into room "WHAT LOUD FRIEND" Elf "Oh, yeah, okay." Sn kills min. We march surrenderer into the room. Sn "Do you have any rope?" K takes m's hand and grinds a dagger into it, fucking it up "Any funny business, and I'll do the other." Elf "Just us, we've turned the bar into a hold-out." E: "Any other holdouts?" Elf+k "Maybe? Market may be okay. We were just told to defend the sewer entrances, but the forces were heavy, so we fell back to a defensive position after most of our guys were killed." Sn "Sliscus" Grumbles, "Probably." E wants to go find his girlfriend. "Can you send reenforcements if you're heading back in? We're getting tired, and you say there may be some survivors behind us."

We can see the market through the door, as we knew it, but quite empty. "Most everyone's fallen back to the inner market. If you cross the bridge to the double doors, you'll find them." E thinks he sees gold in the sewage, F sees market stalls floating by. We sneak across the river. The market is now makeshift beds and bodies, tending to the wounded. There's a makeshift bedchamber with guards. Guards look disbelieving "Where the fuck have you been? better go talk to the boss." E "WHERE'S MEDINA AND TOV GOD DAMNIT EDINAAAAA" from across the market "WHAAAAAAT?" dwarves head to edina, kobolds to sliscus "He was wounded in the fighting." Sn "Can you help, S?" S "Sure." Sliscus has a teeeeensy cut on his leg, trying to relax. We also see Rosea in the room. Sn "We've got an unexpected pair here." Sl "Where were you?" Sn "Mountains out of town trying to figure out where the carts are going. Found out, fortunately/unfortunately. Prisoners were being taken out to be experimented on by a human mage to try and create something" Sl "V fucking useful" Sn "Sorry I'm not fucking prescient" S heals the papercut "How's the plan going in terms of destabilizing the society?" Sl "Sucks. The prison's a joke now, not worth going for" Sn "Rosea, what's going on up above?" R "With all the activity around the sewers, the polit/Ira sent down an expeditionary force to the market, then sent down a significant portion of his forces." sn "Anyone in the polit know you're down here?" R "thankfully not" S "Have you been to see Said yet?" Sl "she knows he's been...taken care of" Sn "What's left of the market down here?" Sl "We had warning, so we enacted our plans. The first wave was able to hold out, so the plan was to send others out down the river to Isfahan to save them, but as you can see that's not quite how it unfolded. The bulls used shields, we used kobolds below, then humans, then bulls. I got hurt too. Strange that...I think (corgi will send this to me.)" Sl "S when I saw the explosion, I noticed two members of your guild, twins, fighting. they (corgi will send)" Sl sits back on the bed and looks resigned as to whatever else is going to happen. S "Do you have any more of those nice, shiny explosives? We could take out the prison from below?" Sl frump, R alarmed. R "that would likely kill the people you're looking to free" Sn "They'll likely get a summary execution in the next few days, anyway. They were being held to be experimented on by the human sorcerer by some members of the polit" S shows R the letter from Said's office. R "I suspected something foul" Sn "We got rid of the wizard, returned to the city with the schedule of carts and other docs, be able to break the prisoners free. However, as soon as any other minos get to Kholeno, discover the bodies, and come back, I assume all the magicians will be killed, being of no more use to the traitors in the polit." R "fair assessment" Sn "We were hoping for a couple of weeks, probalby only a few more days to attempt." R "Though it pains me, I agree. Do you still desire to make the attempt?" Sn "Do you know if any wizards survived?" Sl "No idea" Sn "We got some papers from Kholeno that we couldn't read ourselves. Some are in elvish. They may be implicating, R." hands them over. R "If you still wish to break into the prison, here's this -hands paper over- Here's a crude copy of the plans to the prison"

We figure out some more about the layout. R "i've not brought this to you without an ulterior motive. These problems with the polit, even an idiot can tell this all begins with Ira." S "It would likely begin with Jaroudi" R, taken aback, "If he were to be removed somehow, more reasonable voices might be able to command the room once more." S "Ooh ooh! Are we going to stab someone in the back?" Sn "the idea has crossed my mind, but unfortunately we've not looked into any of his routines. Not to mention, every building in the polit has had some level of wizard or sorcerer in their allegiance" R "Having taken trips to them, I've seen much the same" Sn "If you were to assassinate Ira, when/where would you do it?" R points to third floor, bottom right room, "He has something of an away-home there. If I were to assassinate him, that would be the easiest time to do it." Sn "New, but interesting news. I like it." R "The reason I'd say easiest, he thinks no one knows where he is at that point." Sn "In fairness to Ira, I wouldn't have guessed that. In this case -thinks- This wouldn't be just planning a prison break, we'd have to clear the whole thing, otherwise we'd have to fight our way out." Sl "All this sounds rather fanciful. Easiest is to cut and run, any tarrying could risk all of us." Sn to S "How do you feel about tomorrow for ass/prison break" S "Didn't have other plans. Maybe E's boyfriend and girlfriend can help" Sl "Wait, we need everyone we can to help move out" Sn "How many wizards are in there?" R "30-40" Sn "how does that many more to help sound?" Sl "Tempting" sn "We'll need to recoup, but we can go" Sl "You make it sound super simple, but we need everyone we can get right now" Sn "We won't take any of your people" Sl "They're all my people" Sn "If we had a tunneler, that would help" R "Ira committed many of his men down here, the prison is likely less guarded" Sn "We could commandeer a cart, give them info to get us in, or we could climb in through the roof as planned" S "We do have a minotaur potion.." Sn "how about we get together with the other two to talk about it. Going to leave, Sl, if I see you tomorrow night, I succeeded." Sl "So long as you don't take any of my men, I don't give a fuck. We'll be leaving within three days, so whatever."

E offers Edina a sip of health potion. F "Edina, I apologize for what I said about Munjim earlier. Grief affects some in different ways, that was uncalled for. Jarvin, may I ask you something? I've been told this pendant is a dwarven religious symbol" J "yes. This is ancient. Where'd you get it?" F "From my mother when I was tiny" J "You've been truly blessed, this is from the second age. Most likely purely decorative, but v special. Image of Saul." F "One of the five artifacts?" J "Nah, this is just a trinket from the age he lived" F "Feels more special now, thanks -to tov- You doing well? Take any damage?" T "Bashed fIVE FUGGIN HEADS IN feelin' good" E "Into doing some more?" T flexes "ALWAYS" F "The horn, have you made anything of it?" T "Made anything? no. Learned? yes. Heating it and binding it would fuck it up right and proper, but if you look here, the edge is hard, would make a fine dagger with the right treatment. Would need diamond filament to dig into it for screws to bind it to a handle, would make a great dirk. Would be one in any city, except this shithole. Braeburn industries had access to all manner of tools." F takes it back.

S checks up on melo, who is very melancholic and missing one leg. S gets upset, "Tid?" M "He was...under the rubble" S healing touches, "Can we do anything?" M "Gonna get the fuckers who did this" S "We have our own plans, but they may intersect, as we're looking to apply some knives to one of the fuckers who did it. Know of who has the explosives?" M "Nah. Going to move on out of the city, most of the guild died in the attack, as the guild HQ was by the explosion. We're cutting our losses and run back to Alsahali" S "Black kobold have anything to do with this? He seems to have something against the guild." M "Not that I know of. Fuck him." S "Any of the emerald stock survive? Would be a bargaining chip" M "Not that I know of. We've been sending stuff back home, operation wasn't a complete loss. This one's going to be a complete fucking loss to me." M starts crying, S and M share a toast and share a flask of alcohol.

We notice the elf lorien from the cart walking over to us, "My condolences." S "You on your way out?" L "Maybe not. I heard there might be something going at the prison?" S "We're not _not_ doing anythign" L "When?" S "Not _not_ tomorrow" L "Then I'll not _not_ make plans. do me a favor?" S "I'll entertain the idea." L "If you see an elderly elf down there, can you ensure he escapes with no harm come to him?" S "We'll do our best, we're going to break everyone out" L "You'll have my thanks." wanders off
