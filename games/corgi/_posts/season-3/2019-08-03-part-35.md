We head toward graveyard. We see some sort of light blue paths in the shifting sands, we see figures walking along those paths. One of the jackal clan greets us there and tells us to have fun in the tomb, doesn't expect us to leave alive. Inside, we find an undead minotaur who has raised mummies and stone jackals. When we kill him eventually, all the undead and stone jackals crumble. We find a bag of devouring on him and an axe in the chamber behind him containing a God/demon. Eragon coaxes the demon into his sword to level it up, but he has to also take the bag and feed it 10lbs of meat every 13 days.
