We run into a sandstorm and it takes out all our tents. We're helped out afterward by a new minotaur, Ahnur Esim. He brings us back to a small oasis, kept incredibly fertile via his magic. We rest at his place, sensing that he means us no harm.

There is some hammering on the door, the Cabal has found us and wants us to give them the dragon. We try to break down the door, but it fails. Instead, the two minotaurs dimension-door out of the place and start attacking. One of the mages shoots a fireball through the window and sets the place alight. Sarai blinks out with Nancy. We fight and defeat the Cabal, though they're mostly crows and such, transforming between them and shadow-teleporting.

There's one crow we knock out and clip his wings. We try interrogating him, but he won't talk. Eventually we let him go, which surprises him. Faolan and Sarai keep whispering, growing less kind toward the Cabal, and wary of this new companion. They'll have to make sure he stays on their side and doesn't slip toward either the Cabal or Jaroudi.
