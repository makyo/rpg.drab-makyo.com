Augt harvests some dragon's blood tree wood.

We return to camp. Augt asks Tov how to work with magic while he works with wood. Wants to know how to make something really cool. We head to Old Simbel, but there's a sandstorm heading in our direction again. The sand is moving around things at aren't there in unnatural ways. There's some crazy person with lions and ghost archers out there attacking us. We discover that they're the tribe of the lions and they're upset that we brought the orb. The leader, Masudi, brings us to their camp after some discussion. We basically change our opinion on the Cabal over time, partly because of israfil and partly because of their unyielding conservative attitude and how they treated us.
