[Corgi's D&D Campaign](/games/corgi)

We find an inn that's 7gp/night/person, Augt goes to work on wood. Eragon gets some beer-flavored water.

Next day, Augt goes to woodworking, helping out guildmaster.

Eragon goes to talk to the politburo. Asks minotaur after Said, minotaur gets upset saying that if there's an enemy of the revolution, he will need to be routed. Eragon tries to arrange a meeting with Said, but minotaur wants to know what's going on.

Faolan goes outside the walls to try to learn more about the dwarven refugees. Has a bit of a hard time convincing them that he's a good leader. going to try and get a forge set up for the artisans.

Sarai has bad luck trying to get emeralds, too bourgeois.

Eragon meets up with Said, who's kinda pissed that folks know about the two. Says "the general you were sent to assassinate is quite popular with the military, and I'm not sure if he can be trusted" "Why?" "It's no secret that our leader is ill and there will be a struggle for power. As someone who was a former noble, I'm sure you can understand succession crises. I'm secretary for external affairs and I want a message sent that I'm in charge of the military, not the generals. I'll make sure your fighting equipment is returned, you're gonna need it"

Outside, he finds the minotaur he spoke to earlier. "What did he say?" "He is a counterrevolutionary who wishes to have your head of military dead." "Why, half the politburo wants him gone. You're going to have to find some way of bringing him back to the city without anyone knowing, then announcing his death to the politburo."

Eragon gets sword back, blacksmith likes the sword, offers to sharpen it, but Eragon declines, but feels good for the compliment, tries to shove flex sword up his ass.

Augt makes an okay flute.

Faolan goes to politburo. "I wish to speak to an official who can help me with a little proposition" "Don't talk to me like we're friends, who do you want to talk to?" ... "Is this a bribe?" "I just have an idea to help this city" "What's the proposition?" "As you've noticed, there are refugees. You could get more hands." "Wait here, I'll get someone who might be interested." Minotaur who bought the ring: "I hear you have a proposition" "You have refugees. You could let them rot or bring them into the city to help." "You are their king, so they'd be your responsibility" "What would I be required to do?" "Are you offering to sell your own people into slavery?" "Of course not. They'd be part of your city" "that's slavery. If you want to do this, we can work something out. I kinda like it. What abou tthe angry one?" "You don't want it." "Yeah, that's fair. I can see ~50 we'd like to help swell the ranks" "For suggesting this, might I receive a favor?" "We always have time for people who are looking to make a contribution to the revolution"

Eragon goes to see dwarves outside, holds up his own signet ring. Only some gather. "We are in difficult times, bad people happen. Faolan Truthminer is here to fuel and feed his own greed. The king is safe somewhere. Don't trust him." "Why is the king hiding?" "building upj resistance" "You're from munjim?" "Yes" "where's the safe place? we want to go there."

Sarai goes to market. Gets 25 rations.

Eragon goes to different bookseller, claims to want to write a manifesto. Gets turned down.

Augt hunts for armor, explorer's pack, book, parchment, javelins

We sally forth heading north to munjim.

That night Sarai sees four small figures and one large figure moving towards us quite rapidly, some move quite rapidly and erratically. We try to investigate it, but it blinks away. Sort of a jackal type thing? We run into blink dogs and start defending ourselves. They're sons of bitches. The guy controlling them casts a ridiculous spell on Faolan. Augt makes guy laugh and breaks his concentration. the donald dies :(  They try to tie up the minotaur causing problems. We wind up killing the minotaur and the rest of the dogs, minus one which Sarai will make a pet.
