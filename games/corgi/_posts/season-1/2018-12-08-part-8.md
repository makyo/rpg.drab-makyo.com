[Corgi's D&D Campaign](/games/corgi)

We make it back to the camp with Augt. We give him wood from a palm and spruce in the cave. He just keeps workin' that wood~ He can totally make some shafts out of the wood~ I mean...to replace Sarai's arrows. They're *perfect*. Nancy Pelosi grabs a shaft and runs off to play with her stick. Augt still has the palm wood.

We're back around town and the townspeople are just sort of shrugging and moving the bodies. We get some food and rooms from the innkeeper who's pretty upset with us.

Sarai buys a month worth of grain for the horses. We get a good night's rest. Erogan tries to feed the horse by shoving a handful of grain down its throat. The horse picks up a dwarf fetish. Augt doesn't find an ax worth buying, will try and borrow Erogan's when needed. "For allowing me to tell racist jokes, I'll let you use my ax for *two* trees. If you let me use you when approaching this general, you can cut down *three* trees."

We hunt for the general. We find a stream of water and some sumac berries. We camp. Erogan hears some stuff from the north, sort of like wind being forced in a strange direction. Faolan sees something huge traveling overhead. A giant black shape moving between them and the stars, including the moon.

Continue north. Towards the end of the day, we see a town in the distance. It's busy with minotaurs. A few minotaurs block the way. Erogan says we came from the polit looking for the general. We agree to disarm, but Faolan fails at slight of hand for the dagger. They block all of us. Erogan says Faolan was acting on his own, they hold him during the stay. Nancy gets held too, blinking a little. Sarai stays with Nancy and the cart. Erogan Augt go in.

> She may be a capitalist witch-whore, but she's *my* capitalist witch-whore.

Erogan meets the general, Columbari, who excuses the guards. "There's an enemy of the revolution amongst the high council who sent me to have you killed." "What?!" "There was intrigue!" "There is none, only the revolution." "There are people trying to sabotage it!" "Any more of this talk, and I'll have you killed." Erogan's silent. "Augt, what message did they send you with?" "they want you back to fill you in for new developments" "You should see what's going on" He takes Augt and Erogan out of the city. There's a big line carved in the road guarded by minotaurs. They stop in front of the line. "One of you, why don't you step to the other side of this line?" Augt steps over. Guy puts hand on the back of his neck. It takes a while for Augt to see it, but stuff is moving on that side of the line. There are a bunch of really feral minotaurs and dwarves running toward Augt on that side of the line. The general yanks him back, and the mino/dwarves look lost and wander away.

"What happened at munjim?" "Great disaster, people died, we're trying to figure it out" "More details plz" Erogan tells story "Normally I wouldn't believe this, but given the things we've seen and the creature last night. how it didn't kill you is beyond me, great winged creature, it killed 20 of our men, ate 3, moved off." "Our number is small, maybe it didn't see us." "It was probably full." "I'm glad you arrived, we're planning to push toward the bridge. The enemy forces need to cross this bridge so they can set up a base on our side of the chasm. We want to destroy it so they can't make a camp on this side. We have a bomb that can take out this bridge" "Okay" "Good news, you've both been conscripted into the revolutionary force." He lays out a map on the table, "Our forces are planning on pushing up, while others flank to try and blow up the bridge. Everything was looted." "Ah, the greed of capitalists" "Indeed. We're planning to attack tonight." "one of my proteges has an asset that can teleport the bomb"

They bring in folks, lifting Faolan and sarai, "They have *these things*" "Ah, we need the blood-sucking vampire." Nancy Pelosi teleports around to show off. "WTF?!?! You, money-obsessed whore, what is this?" Sarai explains, explains pet. "Good, I'll send you with it. The lizard is expendable, we'll send it with the bomb, using it's strange capitalist movement-dog. Does it work on money? We'll send the non-minotaurs to arm the bomb. We'll send Augt and a commissar to ensure loyalty." Erogan: "I'll use my darkvision!" "I'll stick you on my shoulders and you can point stuff out."

"We're going to go up the central street and make as much noise as possible. Meanwhile, she (commissar) will take you around, and once you blow up the bridge, we'll make a fighting retreat. I find they die when you kill them. Make sure you destroy their heads." They show: they attack one of the bad minotaurs' bodies. The head sprouts wings and tries to fly away. arcana checks: you get the feeling this is unnatural, but Augt sees a faint outline of a dome rising from the line. "before you go, have one of our enchanters bless your weapons. We'll go along ahead on the road. We'll have you wait. The second you can hear us yelling, make your move around the back. We'll see the explosion." Erogan offers a plan. "Our plan isn't to beat them, it's to buy the bomb plan enough time. I don't have enough men to do this plan." Faolan's potions

Columbari gives a rah speech. "This capitalist whore will go around the back and destroy the bridge for us!" He holds Sarai up like Simba. We get Inspiring Leader and Magic Weapons. Erogan gains Zealous Presence.

We ride to battle. The main block runs into demons. demon heads frighten the minotaurs, but Columbari's inspiring leader cancels disadvantage. He pulverizes a head. Dwarves slam into the army and cause some damage. Erogan accidentally crossbows a guy in the front. Other group sneaks forward.

Main group: Columbari does some damage, Erogan does a lot, tries to sell minotaurs on dwarven weapons.

(I'm going to stop recording all battles because I don't know that it's useful.)

Main group does some more damage, gets a bit of damage.

Side group kills minotaur in the way and sneaks around building.

Main group is doing pretty okay against enemies. Enemies are kinda bouncing off them. Sorry, undead critters.

Side group is sneaking up pretty well, running up around the buildings.

Main group still going well.

Side group: Augt fails stealth, attracts minotaurs, Sarai tries to dash up behind, fails stealth, Faolan runs up, yells "YOU GAY FROGS" and then dashes back around the building, where he spots a giant fuckoff minotaur who doesn't see him.

Main group gets attacked a bit more.

Augt sleeps a minotaur. Nancy teleports way ahead with Sarai on the bomb.

Main gets a little less good.

Minotaurs kill Augt. Sarai and Faolan dash to bridge. Sarai drops and arms the bomb and runs away. A giant fucking critter runs up to it, sniffs it and runs off. The bomb explodes and takes out the bridge. Everything gets sorta knocked about and startled. We all run off. The commissar grabs Aught and carries off. Everyone just kinda dashes back to the city.

We make it back to the camp and they fix up Augt. It's kinda sombre, even if Columbari is cheering everyone up. They don't feel a bloodthirsty rage at Sarai.
