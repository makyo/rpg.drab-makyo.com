With Augt's help, Faolan and Eragon managed to wrest some shelving from the wall to pile up against the entrance through which they'd arrived.

Sarai paced and prowled, recovering what arrows she could, before eventually making her way over to the king. There was a concerned, sleepy look on his face, in death, as though he were mulling over some troubling dream. The kobold bent down and gently tugged at a corner of paper sticking out from his vest.

The crunch of a boot nearby made her jump back, claws clacking against the pommel of her sword. Eragon was giving her a dark look, though the moment passed and he shrugged.

"Might as well, lizard. If the king is fallen and, I suspect, Munjim itself about to fall, we should take what we can. Someone will need to rally."

Sarai nodded cautiously, relaxing her posture. She did not, however, move to the body, instead letting Eragon rifle the king's corpse.

Faolan let out a muffled shout, which was almost immediately followed by a low rumbling. "Sarai's right! Move!"

The path from the storeroom was short indeed. The four bound up a short flight of steps, pausing only to let Augt crash through a rotted door shoulder first, and they were out in the night air. Cool, fresh air, and the rumbling, much louder now, greeted them.

A quick glance told them they'd come out of a small grotto right at the the innermost angle of the customs yard, leaving a flat expanse and abandoned carts before them.

Behind them, the mountain was coming down.

Sarai came too with a start.

The rumbling hadn't ceased, which was either a good sign or a bad sign, depending on which way she looked at it. Good, because that mean that she hadn't been out long after the rock had struck her in the back of the head. Bad, because the mountain was still gleefully on throwing rocks at them.

Augt grabbed the kobold by the collar of her vest and hauled her upright. leading her out toward the far end of the customs yard.

Faolan was also bleeding from a scrape above his ear, but still grinning widely. The latter was likely due to the good-sized gold bar he held in one hand. "No one watching the carts. I figure we'll need it for the road. We also found some dried meat and tack."

"Good," Sarai mumbled. "We should move as soon as--"

With a resounding crack, the roof of the cavern in which Munjim had grown gave way.

That would have been spectacle enough to draw their gaze, but along with it came a sick, red light. It was a red that seemed to seep beneath Sarai's scales, one that tugged at her. A slimy red that stole her breath.

Even as the red sprang up, the stars went out. The blank darkness of the sky hurt their eyes to look at, but the blood-red moon drew their gaze all the same.

"The sand!" Augt cried.

The ground itself seemed to have caught the light of the stars, glowing a pale green-tinged white beneath their feet.

Sarai thought she might be ill.
