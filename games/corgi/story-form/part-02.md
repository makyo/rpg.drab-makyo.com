With Augt's help, Faolan and Eragon managed to wrest some shelving from the wall to pile up against the entrance through which they'd arrived.

Sarai paced and prowled, recovering what arrows she could, before eventually making her way over to the king. There was a concerned, sleepy look on his face, in death, as though he were mulling over some troubling dream. The kobold bent down and gently tugged at a corner of paper sticking out from his vest.

The crunch of a boot nearby made her jump back, claws clacking against the pommel of her sword. Eragon was giving her a dark look, though the moment passed and he shrugged.

"Might as well, lizard. If the king is fallen and, I suspect, Munjim itself about to fall, we should take what we can. Someone will need to rally."

Sarai nodded cautiously, relaxing her posture. She did not, however, move to the body, instead letting Eragon rifle the king's corpse.

Faolan let out a muffled shout, which was almost immediately followed by a low rumbling. "Sarai's right! Move!"

The path from the storeroom was short indeed. The four bound up a short flight of steps, pausing only to let Augt crash through a rotted door shoulder first, and they were out in the night air. Cool, fresh air, and the rumbling, much louder now, greeted them.

A quick glance told them they'd come out of a small grotto right at the the innermost angle of the customs yard, leaving a flat expanse and abandoned carts before them.

Behind them, the mountain was coming down.

-----

Sarai came too with a start.

The rumbling hadn't ceased, which was either a good sign or a bad sign, depending on which way she looked at it. Good, because that mean that she hadn't been out long after the rock had struck her in the back of the head. Bad, because the mountain was still gleefully on throwing rocks at them.

Augt grabbed the kobold by the collar of her vest and hauled her upright. leading her out toward the far end of the customs yard.

Faolan was also bleeding from a scrape above his ear, but still grinning widely. The latter was likely due to the good-sized gold bar he held in one hand. "No one watching the carts. I figure we'll need it for the road. We also found some dried meat and tack, and some sumac that perhaps we can use."

"Good," Sarai mumbled. "We should move as soon as--"

With a resounding crack, the roof of the cavern in which Munjim had grown gave way.

That would have been spectacle enough to draw their gaze, but along with it came a sick, red light. It was a red that seemed to seep beneath Sarai's scales, one that tugged at her. A slimy sort of red that stole her breath.

Even as the red sprang up, the stars went out. The blank darkness of the sky hurt their eyes to look at, but the blood-red moon drew their gaze all the same.

"The sand!" Augt cried.

The ground itself seemed to have caught the light of the stars, glowing a pale green-tinged white beneath their feet.

Sarai thought she might be ill.

They made it about a mile from the customs yard, with the last of Munjim still in view, before camping. Despite the evil quality to the night, that they had just fought their way through ruined dwarves and something which had only had the fair semblance of an elf was catching up with them.

Eragon volunteered to take first watch. Sarai found it odd how little the death of their king seemed to affect the dwarves.

Or perhaps it wasn't that his death wasn't affecting them so much as it seemed to have each of their minds spinning in different directions. Eragon, when he spoke, had shown great concern for those of his people who had survived, and by the time they settled into camp for the night, he had begun to speak of leadership.

Faolan, on the other hand, mostly seemed quiet and contemplative, though the crafty grin of his never seemed to leave his face for long.

By morning, some sense of normalcy had returned. The moon during Sarai's watch had started to look like a moon once more, and Faolan, after sheepishly admitting to having fallen asleep during the final watch, said that the stars were once more starting to come out.

The next few days were days of travel. The kobold was accustomed to such, and the minotaur seemed to plod on without much of a care in the world, though the dwarves did not fare as well.

After resting through the heat of the day the path they followed intersected and cleaved to a ravine through which trickled a meager stream. Sarai, from her travels, knew that the path to Fustat existed almost solely because of the stream, and that they would be able to follow it most of the way to the city itself.

In order to stretch their rations, Sarai attempted to show her travelling companions a trick she had learned with sumac, where a few berries would keep even the minotaur fed and on his feet for a day, but her words quickly failed her, and she resigned herself to simply making such for the group as needed to supplement their rations.

By the third day, all four were thankful for such, as their sole attempt at hunting had involved Eragon sending an arrow glancing off Faolan's backside, who had, in his shock, then shot at Sarai.

Augt once more proved his worth by bandaging such scrapes.

It was a grumpy group that, on the eve of the third day, came across a snare set in the rocks by the ravine. Hastily set and empty, but a sign of fellow travelers nonetheless. They continued up the road more warily after that.

Some tack softened in water mashed up with berries did little to help raise their spirits, and exhaustion mixed with wariness made for poor conversation.

Before they could set a watch for the night, Eragon hushed them into silence Gesturing further down the road. "Fire?"

Sarai nodded. "A few, perhaps. Some of your kin?"

The dwarf nodded and reshouldered his pack. "We should see."

There was minimal grumbling as they pressed onward through the gloaming. They skirted around a low rise as quietly as possible, though Eragon in his mail was having a hard time keeping from making too much noise, and after a particularly loud rustle, the fire before them was quickly doused, and they were dropped into darkness once more.

"Who's there?" Came a low, urgent voice. "Many of us! Who's there?"

Slinking past Eragon and making a sign for the others to wait, Sarai continued on. The dwarf had stepped in another small snare, so she supposed it had been these who had been setting them, perhaps hoping to backtrack the next morning to check for small prey. The others waited as the kobold continued on.

The low shapes were confusing to make out. The forms that were people were well dressed for the high desert, and their gear fit them so well that telling the two apart was difficult at best. Still, she counted three figures moving, supposing that they were either men or elves, and she was ill-disposed toward elves, after the events in Munjim.

There was another soft rustle and a curse behind her in Eragon's gruff voice. The rustle from the camp sounded decidedly like arms being brought to bear on the sound.

Acting on instinct, Sarai stood up from where she had crouched and approached the group slowly, hands held out before her with palms up. "Hold! Nice to see some friendly faces, we did not mean to startle you," she said in what she hoped was a soothing voice, appending a hint of a bow and a flourish of the tail.

After a moment's hesitation, the three men - for she decided they had to be men - lowered their spears and returned the bow with nods of their own.

"What business brings you to these parts?" she asked, masking a sigh of relief.

"Trade. Traveling. Goods." The reply was halting and coarse, the accent rough, as though the lingua franca was still new to them.

"And you?" A smoother voice brought Sarai's attention to the packs, where a lithe figure was unfolding themselves from where they were seated on the ground. "What business brings a kobold this far east?"

"Trade also. I am an envoy from my guild seeking to purchase emeralds." She suspected this new voice belonged to an elf, but she also suspected the three men before her were perfectly competent with those spears, so she had no desire to come off as anything but friendly. She added in a lighthearted tone, "Do you have any to trade? I will pay competitive rates."

"Of course, a kobold looking to trade." The voice sounded tired, amused. "Alas, but we have no emeralds. From whence do you travel, little one?"

Sarai stiffened and contemplated briefly how much to answer before waving vaguely northwest. "Just down the road."

The elf seemed to be making his own calculation before he - and Sarai guessed it must be a 'he' - nodded and beckoned her with. "Come. I would like to take you to speak with our leader. We came from Fustat to trade with the dwarves at Munjim al'Jawahir, as we do regularly. You must excuse the men, the hill folk. We use them for wayfinding, but they are not much for conversation."

"May I bring my traveling companions?"

"The loud ones?" The elf laughed. "Yes, but be forewarned that we are quite well-armed, should you have ill intent."

By the time Sarai returned with Augt and Faolan, Eragon having decided to remain with the packs (though Sarai brought her bow, Faolan his rapier, and Augt his ironwood wrapped in the Munjim rug), the elf had managed to light a torch, and she could see him for the trader he was. Coarser than the elves that had borne Rola Tabsh into the palace in Munjim, but still bearing the fine caramel skin and mien of his race. "A kobold, a dwarf, and a minotaur! Wonder of wonders. Come."

The faint glow from over the next rise told the trio that the main camp had relit their own fires, and they were greeted with the sight of a large camp, crowded with men and elves, two carts at the center with horses staked nearby.

The elderly elf who greeted them looked up in surprise at Augt. "Oh! You are slavers!"

The minotaur frowned, and Sarai could see him balling his fists at his sides, so close to her head as they were.

"Ah, forgive me," the woman amended. "I forget myself, such is no longer legal. My apologies, beast."

"I am known to my people and companions as Augt." His voice sounded tight, strained. "You may address me as such. I travel freely with my companions Sarai and Faolan."

The elf bowed. "Well met, Augt, Sarai, Faolan. You may address me as Kandake. How came you to this area?"

Sarai, seeing the finery of Kandake's dress, gave a deeper bow and flourish. "We came from Aleawalim, bypassing Munjim."

"Bypassing? Why not stop there?"

"We met Faolan on the road, and he has errand in Fustat, where we also seek trade."

Kandake frowned and, after a few moments, nodded. "Come. Let us see your wares. Perhaps we could trade here before we we part ways."

Augt, having relaxed, spoke up. "We have left our packs in hiding. We would need to retrieve them before trading more fully. However, as a token of our intent, perhaps we may make due with this?" He unwound the rug from his 'staff' of ironwood.

The elf's eyes widened, and she made a quick chopping gesture with her hand. Sarai had seen such before, and quickly dove to the side, covering her face.

The flash was intense and the noise loud, and Sarai could sense both Augt and Faolan stumbling back. "Wait! Wait! We come for trade! We mean no harm!"

"Then why do you lie?" Kandake's voice remained steady and confident, and all the more dangerous for it. "You say you skirt Munjim, and yet bring Munjim wool to trade. Think carefully before you speak, Sarai."

"We...we came from Munjim, yes. We stopped there, and are traveling to Fustat for trade. You have our word."

"Strange lights shine from the mountains to the north, and now strange travelers on the road, lying about where they have been."

"I speak truth. We were were there to trade."

"I know that," Kandake snapped. "You are a kobold, you trade. It is in your blood. I did not ask why you were there. I want to know what *happened*."

"There was an Elven ambassador. He promised riches. There was a giant party, then a massacre, and then the mountain came down around us"

"Diplomats? A party? You may be telling the truth, but not nearly enough, Sarai. If you do not provide specifics, I will not hesitate to loose an arrow between your eyes."

Faolan had recovered from the flash of the stunning arrow and spoke up next. "The dead rose! The mountain came down! There was a...a thing in the shape of an elf, shadow stuff that fought, died, and fought again. The moon turned red as blood, the stars went out and--"

Kandake held up her hand, and both her and the trio looked about, alarmed.

The men of the hill tribes had fallen to their knees as one and were keening toward the sky, arms raised.
