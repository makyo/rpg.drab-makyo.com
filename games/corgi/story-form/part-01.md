Hopping down from the bed of the cart, Sarai Azoulay slipped her pack onto her shoulders once more, buckled her short sword to her belt once more, and dug in one of her vest's many pouches, parting reluctantly with five coppers for the last night's fare of her journey.

The first night on the road to Munjim al'Jawahir, she'd done her best to earn her keep. Men, dwarves, and the odd minotaur, however, were far sturdier folk than kobolds, and she could do little to keep up. She'd had to settle for spending five coppers a night for the next six nights of the journey from Aleawalim, quickly eating into her ready cash for the trip. The only reason she'd even gotten that rate was for her help in finding food and water on the road. That, after all, required neither strength nor indeed much effort. She was in her element, and knew the hills well enough.

She just needed to get to Munjim, get her trade on, and move on. This whole scheme depended on her never staying in place for long, and if she could make it down to Aijtimae before the rains came, she'd probably still be on track.

The carts, circled now within the customs yard, had a lengthy procedure ahead of them, but Sarai had all of her wares on her, both within her pack and secreted in the many pockets of her traveling vest. Her trade would be fast, easy, and small.

At least at first.

The scheme dreamed up in her guild back home was a bit short on details, but easy enough to implement. Sarai, as the one with the most experience on the road, was to gin up the emerald trade in the eastern kingdoms. Get it moving smoothly through several fronts, buy here, sell there, never hold much stock at once - at least not to the outside eyes. After all, her pack was double-walled, and between the lining and the outside were several fortunes worth of the precious stones.

Once the trade was moving rapidly, she'd dump all of her stock over the course of a few short days, crashing the new, still fragile market.

Then she, through one of her more magnanimous fronts, would come in and start buying up again. The goal was for her to, at the very least, come back home with twice the emerald stock that she had left with, where the gems could be sold at a fantastic markup out west.

Worst case - and the guild had stressed the 'worst' part of this outcome - she'd be able to come back with a small profit and the gems in her pack untouched.

Sarai wasn't quite sure how she felt about the scheme. It was mostly sound in theory, but it was a theory based upon the guild's expectations of how the eastern kingdoms worked. Expectations that weren't uninformed so much as incomplete. Sarai had traveled the area far more than others in her guild had, and knew far more than she really wanted to about the dwarves and minotaurs in the area. Which had, of course, been the guild's justification for sending her.

There was also the suspicion that, as a relatively difficult kobold, getting her out from underclaw was a second, unspoken reason for sending her.

She shook her snout scuffed her way up the steps and into the city proper.

-----

Munjim had been built some enormous number of years ago by the dwarves in the area. Mountainous types, split off an even larger number of years before from the hill folk to the north, they hadn't so much built a city as carved one out of the side of the mountains which leaped so dramatically from the plains there.

The city would have been big enough, had it been only what one could see from the front, but in truth, it stretched well into the mountain out of which it had been carved. A cavern there had been enlarged and buildings constructed within, with shafts drilled through the mountainside to provide enough light to keep the city in a constant dim twilight, as well as to keep the air fresh.

A few paces into the entrance to the city proper, Sarai paused to revel in the welcome coolness of the cavern and let her eyes adjust away from the brightness of the day.

She knew the next steps.

She'd start at the top, though her expectations were low, which meant heading to the palace.

It was, as always, bedecked out front by a loose queue of traders, nobles, penitents, and even a few bound criminals. Perhaps there was a trail set in one of the lesser halls. All of them were dwarves.

Well, all but one.

The minotaur looked as though he'd be awkward even among his own kind, but surrounded as he was by dwarves, the tallest of whom came up to his belt, he looked downright comical.

Partly out of pity, partly to not be another lonely non-dwarf in a sea of dwarves, Sarai quickly edged her way through the line until she was parked alongside him. There was some grumbling, sure, but the kobold suddenly looked like that's just where she belonged, and she slipped from the dwarves' minds. Sarai had learned early on: never underestimate the power of simply looking like you belong where you are.

"Hey friend. What's your business here among the dwarves?"

The minotaur stumbled to the side a half step, nearly knocking over a merchant who, by his scent, seemed to deal in horses. He reached into his pocket and withdrew a thick sheaf of papers, which he thrust at Sarai automatically before stopping short. "You're not a dwarf."

"Neither are you."

There was a strained silence before Sarai smiled disarmingly, having to crane her head back to look up to the beast - she was shorter than many of the dwarves. "I'm not here to check your papers. You can put those away. Just wondering what a minotaur was doing this far from al'Abqar, is all."

The minotaur hiked his own pack up further onto his shoulder and tucked his papers back into his vest from where he'd grabbed them. "Selling, hopefully buying."

"What do you trade in?"

"I buy wood, I sell wood carvings. Not carpentry, mind. Wood carvings. The fine stuff. Very important distinction that many miss, there."

Sarai nodded. "I suppose there is, at that." She had picked a good companion, as it were, to enter the halls with. Someone trading in finery, but not the same type as she was planning to trade in. "What's your name, anyhow?"

"Augt." The minotaur gave a slight bow, leading to Sarai taking a half step back. It was hard not to feel like so tall a creature would fall onto her.

Sarai gave a flourish with her tail - greeting enough among kobolds - followed by a short bow of her own. "Sarai. May your wares sell and your competitors fail."

The minotaur looked sick, at which Sarai had a private smile. The beasts were smart enough, often quite cunning, but, well...if there were a polar opposite to the kobolds' trading empire and prowess, the minotaurs were it. They only traded as a matter of necessity. They didn't know the true joy of feeling money and good flow, of power of wealth accumulated. Ah well, poor fools.

The queue moved along with the stolid efficiency that was common to the dwarves, and before long, kobold and beast were at the door.

Sarai gestured for the minotaur to precede her. Her pitch would likely go over better for the one in front of her being less grand. Before Augt had a chance to act one way or another, the guards at the door used the hafts of their ceremonial axes to prod both in at the same time.

Wrong footed, Sarai and Augt both stumbled through the doors and into the chill, echoing hall.

What the dwarves lacked in nicety, they made up in grandeur. The space seemed larger even than the cavern that contained the palace. Simple banners hung between the columns, looking all the more grand for their simplicity. The floor echoed claw- and hoofsteps, the marble tile unmarred by carpet or rug.

Lining the walkway toward the king stood parallel rows of the court, courtiers, and the old families, standing nearly at attention, cold eyes following the traders.

"Well?" The king's voice was bored, frustrated. "Say your piece."

With another tail-flourish and bow, both far more respectful, Sarai stepped forward. "Your majesty, your humble servant travels from Ard Alsahali by way of Aleawalim for trade. I seek to purchase emeralds and bring in exchange gold. By your leave, I would trade in your city and, should it please the crown, with the court itself."

"And you?"

Augt's papers were already out in his oversized hands, hoof-tipped fingers trembling has he thrust them toward the king and bowed. It was a sideways gesture, curious unless you knew that it was intended to point the horns away from the recipient. Sarai had traded - or attempted to trade - with the minotaurs enough to have guessed such. "Your majesty, your humble servent travels from Ard al'Abqar for trade. I seek to purchase fine wood and in exchange bring grain for brewing, and my skills as a master carver of fine--"

The king held up a gauntleted hand. Augt fell silent. "I'm well aware of the trade of the kobolds, and I understand even the...righteous minotaurs deign occasionally to trade with us." With a creak of his armor, he leaned forward, a smile touching the corners of his mouth. "But I don't believe you. Either of you. Why are you really here? A single kobold is nearly unheard of, and Munjim al'Jawahir has not requested grain from the polit."

Sarai was ready for this. One had to be ready, but she had experienced such from the dwarves before. "Your majesty, by your leave, I will explain. My guild has sent me as a lone representative as one well versed in travel between cities to pole the sands and check our prospects before a more, ah...expensive venture is to be undertaken. Think of me as an trade emissary."

The king looked thoughtful, nodded, and turned an imperceptible amount toward Augt.

"Your majesty, by your leave, I will explain. We have wood in al'Abqar, but only of a few kinds. On behalf of my union, I seek finer wood for finer arts," he said. This seemed well rehearsed.

The king laughed. "We live in a cave, my very tall friend. Do you suppose many trees grow down here?"

Augt's features went from hopeful to hopeless in a heartbeat.

"To think that we might want beer from a lizard and a cow." There was another laugh from the throne, this more cruel than the last. "You're going to have to do better than that. Come, I see a flute, show me you mean it."

Sarai's eyes darted up toward the minotaur, who shakingly unsheathed what Sarai had supposed was some short staff, though seeing it in Augt's hands, she realized just how small it was to the beast. He carefully extracted a fine-looking wooden flute and put it to his lips.

"And you, lizard, shall accompany your traveling companion."

The performance was terrible. Humiliating. Augt, though he may have been a fine flutist, produced a few creaky melodies while Sarai, unwilling to risk her position in the court, clapped and swayed along with. She was no musician, no dancer.

The king and his court laughed. When the impromptu duo ceased, the king clapped slowly, a smirk twisting his features. "Most amusing. You shall have to teach my musicians those delightful...you said they were songs?"

Sarai clenched a fist, claws digging against scaly palm.

"You may stay and trade in our city, if you like. Seek what luck you may. Now, the adults have business."

At a gesture, a stately dwarf detached himself from the line near the king and bowed. "Your majesty wishes?"

"Please show our esteemed guests to a room. Their amusement will grant them a bed in the palace tonight." Never had a gift sounded so insulting to Sarai. And the king well knew it, if the glint in his eye was anything to go by.

The courtly dwarf stiffed, nodded slowly and paced down the hall toward Sarai and Augt. He looked less than pleased, but all the same, bowed to the kobold and minotaur, gesturing them out of the hall.

As the trudged toward the door, they were greeted by the pure note of a trumpet, then two, then four.

They had to scurry to the side to allow room for a gilded palanquin to be trotted in before the king. The fineness of their clothing and weapons, the smoothness of their skin, their height, and their gate all gave them away as elves. Rich ones, at that.

Sarai watched over her shoulder as long as she could and listen for as long as she could after.

"Your grace, your grace! How good to see you," a voice sang out. "You're looking well!"

The king's voice was too quiet to be heard, but it sounded far happier than it had with Sarai and Augt.

"Of course, of course! We will commence trade tomorrow. But for you, dear friend, ah! For you, I bring a gift."

And with that, the dwarf had swept them off to a wing of the palace.
