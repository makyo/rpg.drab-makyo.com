We're going to cross at the bridge to the north. A recasts light on his horn. Beste asks if we're okay. "Swiftness is a virtue here, my horned friend." When we step out of the hut, we have to fight a bunch of guys. We kill them. Augt uses shatter, Beste asks what's going on. Kill them all. A turns into a bat and goes searching. Finds the tree with a guy guarding it. Is going to fly directly at him and turn into a minotaur at the last second to attack him. GM makes some faces at this.

A hits, lizard holds up his hands, he holds up his hands, and he and Augt have a halting conversation because he barely speaks. He protects the tree, while elves get their thoughts from it. Maybe shared racial memory? He tells us to get the branch to drink water, but when we do, we run into undead lizard, find a hole to the depths of hell. Faolan looks down, it's awful. We fight zombies and an evil tree, which relinquishes an orb which is the soul of someone who created the good tree corrupted. Augt takes that outside and adds to inventory. He experiences the memories of the elves from thousands of years ago.
