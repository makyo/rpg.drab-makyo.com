It's been a couple hundred years since the minotaurs took over the elven city.

We try to decide whether we're going to conscript the prisoners to get us out there. We're going to have them go upstairs and loot the bodies for weapons. F hollers out for them to abandon communism because it has failed them. Some agree, but Columbari give some sliiightly contradictory orders to go upstairs and loot stuff, but maybe not actually abandon the revolution, and instead go take down the corrupt polit.

S tells A about Israfil, "If he lights you on fire...sorry." A and I like each other. We're going to run upstairs. S calls to C to head upstairs, Sn tells him he has a safe location he can take the prisoners too. We head upstairs and S blinks across the cracks in the floor, while the others acrobatics their way across. L and the old elf are discussing thing in an an elven accent we can't understand. A gasps, "How did Ira die? That's so sad." Pulls out flute and plays Despacito.

S "We were considering leaving, would you pointy ears like to head to the sewers?" L "We were thinking the same" S "Can we get the prisoners there, too?" L "Maybe the Kobolds, not sure about the minotaurs. They can blend into the city"

We hear some noises outside, so we let the elves go ahead. The boss choir starts playing in the background. We get further forward and hear weapons and shields surrounding the building. We have the elves and minotaur prisoners come up ahead. E and Sn argue about the Eraphant.

> You consented, you just didn't know what you were consenting to.

We see maybe 200 minotaurs, including members of the polit + Rosea. R "Would you care to explain the elephant, where you've hid it?" E "Are you implying that elephants are falling out of the sky? That's just silly." R "We suggest you drop your weapons" S "I suggest you let us go and we leave the city forever" Polit looks to each other, Said steps forward "Do you really expect to make it through 300 of our best troops?" Looks like maybe the impostor Said. S "Why should we believe you? Last we saw you, you were being imprisoned beneath the city, guarded by lizards. Care to explain that to us and the rest of the polit?" Said bridles back, "She must be lying" E "And the altar beneath your office?" S "And the letter?" shows it "It made a minotaur's head explode and makes kobolds see visions" Said "Where'd you get that? So, that was you then, was it?" S "When Munjim is destroyed and fell creatures walk the land, we are thorough in our search" Said, jaw quivering, "I've heard enough, destroy them!" F "I am the Truthminer, I was there in Munjim. The fact is, there is a traitor in your midst, we have the real Said hidden safe beneath the ground to keep him from assassination." 26 persuasion. C "In my time in prison here, I have seen strange things in this city" The polit "Is there any truth to this?" R "Recently, I have had dealings with these, and there is truth to this." hands over letter "If this is true, Said and Ira have been conspiring for months to let foreign forces influence the politics in this land" The polit looks through the letter, gasps." S "Ever since we've been here, seeing Said, Ira, Kholeno, there is something rotten in this city" Polit "Do you have the real Said?" S "We left him in the care of our employer. Let us pray he's still alive, but with the fighting underground." Said "I'll go." S "One who is accused should not be the one to judge the truth" Member of the polit, Khavari, who let us borrow his house says he'll go with instead. S "Terms: The rest of the party will not be harmed, Israfil stays with the party, and there is no attack back and forth. You'll forgive me for keeping my sword drawn, there was skirmish down in the market." They agree to terms.

S and K make it to the sewer, market initially skeptical, but S calls out in Draconic "One kobold in the employee Sliscus and one minotaur seeking entrance." Kobolds "You. Do you speak draconic?" K "What did they say?" S "They are asking if you mean them ill will. (to kobolds) No he does not" Kobolds "Isn't he a member of the polit?" S "Well, yes, but he was brought here as part of the mission Sliscus sent us on, which we accomplished but need proof to finish from Slicsus and the member of the polit held beneath the market." Kobolds "Wat" S "Oh, you know Sliscus" Kobolds "You're bringing a member of the polit to sliscus?" S "...Yes"

Enter th emarket to a lot of people's surprise. Schecks on Melo, but then heads to Sliscus with K "Let us in to finish our mission, I bring a member of the polit to sliscus" Guards "Another?" S "Yes, need to talk with sliscus" S "(in Draconic) We have finished our mission and broken the kobolds out of the prison, but need proof of Said before we can finish, as we were greeted by the polit at the door. (In common) Khavari, this is Sliscus, head of the underground market who was keeping Said" K "Uh. Hi." Sl "What the fuck. Do you think he'd recognize his fingers?" S "Perhaps, but I suspect he'd get more out of seeing the rest of Said." Sl "Why would I free him? He won't be happy." S "All we need to do is show that there was an impostor, then you can leave the city" Sl "How about there's a counter offer: I cut off Said's head to prove, and keep Khavari as a hostage?" S "the polit is waiting. if you keep Khavari, they will come down in force. Show us the fingers and let us go" Sl "there are already guards attacking. They can come down here anyway. Third option: "
