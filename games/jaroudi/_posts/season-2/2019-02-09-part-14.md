[Corgi's D&D Campaign](/games/corgi)

We make it out of the cafe. Faolan notices vines and moss and such growing around streets and buildings, uncontrolled.

Erogan tries to convince his armorer to help, no real luck, drinks tea. Sleeps in the sewer with Edina. Sarai and Snipe dream of sterile deserts with only ravens in the skies.

Erogan finds poisoner to get poison for minotaurs. Snipe goes to scope out the coffeeshop. There's a bunch during the middle of the day, then a low ebb during evening, then up again. Old assassin type comes in about noon with lots of respect. Sees Tihan when stealing some food. Follows her.

Sarai heads to the sewer to ask about the dream. Bunches of other Kobolds report having had the dream too, ask Sliscus, who says it's probably nothing but looks nervous. Erogan gets his poison, which is very good, but pretty expensive. Sarai gets a tailblade.

Sarai gets spotted and attacked on the way back, Nancy blinks away, she gets speared for 15 damage, Erogan beans guard in the face, Sarai tailblades, Erogan kills minotaur, they make it back.

We go to see about Tihan. Sneak in not so successfully, Nancy gets pasted, Corgi says incapacitated. Snipe fucking torches the place??Â¿? We mostly kill everyone, but Snipe and Sarai hear voices/magic stuff in the head. We kill a bunch of their strongest folks plus some magical beasts, and the two that are left say they have no quarrel and look like they want to leave.
