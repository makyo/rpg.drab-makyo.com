Primarily Zoroastrianism-esque monotheism, with some desert tribes worshipping local deities. Magic exists, but most aren't aware of it or treat magical things as just "weird things happen sometimes".

Amon - Purity - Represented by light, the sun, and the stars

Cyhtega - Wisdom - Represented by knowledge, scholarly symbols, and long rolls of text

Hastar - Anger - Represented by war, weaponry, and fire
